# Sorting-Methods
This just includes a bunch of code, where I am exploring different sorting methods and how efficient they are in specific cases 

In the world of Computer Science there are many solutions to a single problem. One of the most common answer to a problem would be "it depends"... This is because to find the most efficent solution to a problem is depandant on the type of problem. Something which is considered in these cases are trade offs. A trade off is where you exchange one part of something in comprimise of something else. Common trade offs in computer science would be the measure of how much stoage something takes up (space complexity) or how fast it takes something to compelete (time complexity). 

In the case of sorting methods.. In many cases a program may required to be time efficent where as in other cases it may need too run in a limited memory environment. There are many sorting methods out there with many different trade offs. The purpose of this repository is for me to explore some of these methods and understand how they function. 

The way computer scientists measure the behaviour of time and space complexity is with a mathematical notaion called the "Big O notation". Its notation helps describe how a function tends as it approaches infinity. read more about the Big O notation --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#:~:text=Big%20O%20notation%20is%20a,a%20particular%20value%20or%20infinity.

Edit: I have also added some extra functions which relate to the topics around sorting methds
